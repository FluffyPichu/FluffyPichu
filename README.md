Heya there, I'm FluffyPichu, but you can just call me Pichu.

I'm a big computer nerd who's still learning the basics of programming. I may ocassionally make a project of mine public here.

I also love video games. A bit too much, if I may xD

[I have a Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/fluffypichu876), so feel free to follow me there.

Have a nice day!
